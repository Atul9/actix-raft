=========
In my very humble opinion, Rust is an outstanding language for building new databases, data stores, messaging systems and all of the other things. Books have already been written about this, so I will just say in conclusion:
- We don't need to keep allocating all of the memory of all of the clouds to the JVM.
- We ABSOLUTELY need to move away from all of the memory safety issues which have compromised countless systems.
- Raft is a robust and powerful consensus protocol.
- Huge companies have invested a lot of money in creating actor-based languages specifically for creating databases systems (think FoundationDB), and we already have Actix (thanks Nikolay)!

There are plenty of awesome things to build! Let's do this!
