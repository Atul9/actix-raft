// Raft //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/// An actor which implements the Raft protocol's core business logic.
///
/// For more information on the Raft protocol, see the specification here:
/// https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf (**pdf warning**).
///
/// The beginning of ยง5, the spec has a condensed summary of the Raft consensus algorithm. This
/// crate, and especially this actor, attempts to follow the terminology and nomenclature used
/// there as precisely as possible to aid in understanding this system.
///
/// ### api
/// This actor's API is broken up into 4 different layers, all based on message handling. In order
/// to effectively use this actor, only these 4 interfaces need to considered.
///
/// #### raft request messages
/// These are Raft request PRCs coming from other nodes of the cluster. This interface is
/// implemented as an `actix::Handler`, so a future will be returned which will resolve with the
/// appropriate response type.
///
/// Typically your application's networking layer will decode these message types and simply pass
/// them over to this handler, await the response, and then send the response back over the wire
/// to the caller. However, this is entirely application specific, so at the end of the day, all
/// one needs to do is send the message to this actor, await the response, and then handle the
/// response as needed by your application.
///
/// #### client request messages
/// These are messages coming from your application's clients. This interface is implemented as an
/// `actix::Handler`, so a future will be returned which will resolve with the appropriate
/// response type. Only data mutating messages should ever need to go through Raft. The contents
/// of these messages are entirely specific to your application.
///
/// #### outbound raft request
/// These are messages originating from the Raft actor which are destined for some peer node of
/// the Raft cluster. When the Raft actor is instantiated, an `actix::Recipient` must be supplied
/// which is expected to handle the networking layer logic of actually sending the message to the
/// target peer.
///
/// The networking layer is application specific, so no constraints are put in place in terms of
/// how your application's nodes are to communicate with each other. The only thing that is
/// required is that the message be sent and the response be delivered back.
///
/// Per the Raft spec, message delivery failure from a leader to a follower is to be retried
/// indefinitely, so that is how this actor is implemented.
///
/// #### storage
/// The storage interface is typically going to be the most involved as this is where your
/// application really exists. SQL, NoSQL, mutable, immutable, KV, append only ... whatever your
/// application's data model, this is where it comes to life.
///
/// The storage interface is provided as an `actix::Addr<S: RaftStorage>`. The generic type `S`
/// must implement the `RaftStorage` trait, which is composed of a series of actix message
/// handling traits.
///
/// Depending on the data storage system being used, the actor my be sync or async. It just needs
/// to implement handlers for the needed actix message types.
///
/// Note that currently, when this actor encounters an error from the storage layer, it will stop.
/// The rest of the system may remain online as long as is needed, but this actor will stop in
/// order to avoid data corruption or other such issues.

impl Message for ClientRpcOut {

// TODO:
// ### admin commands
// - get AdminCommands setup and implemented.
//
// ### clients
// - create client message protobuf, used to generically wrap any type of client request.
//   Put together docs on how applications should mitigate client retries which would
//   lead to duplicates (request serial number tracking).
// - implement handler for client requests.
//
// ### observability
// - ensure that internal state transitions and updates are emitted for host application use. Such
// as NodeState changes, membershipt changes, errors from async ops.
//
// ### testing
// - setup testing framework to assert accurate behavior of Raft implementation and adherence to
// Raft's safety protocols.
// - all actor based. Transport layer can be a simple message passing mechanism.
// - will probably need to implement MemoryStroage for testing.
