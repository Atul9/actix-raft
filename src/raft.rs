}

/// An actor which implements the Raft protocol's core business logic.
///
/// For more information on the Raft protocol, see the specification here:
/// https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf (**pdf warning**).
///
/// The beginning of ยง5, the spec has a condensed summary of the Raft consensus algorithm. This
/// crate, and especially this actor, attempts to follow the terminology and nomenclature used
/// there as precisely as possible to aid in understanding this system.
///
/// ### api
/// This actor's API is broken up into 4 different layers, all based on message handling. In order
/// to effectively use this actor, only these 4 interfaces need to considered.
///
/// #### raft request messages
/// These are Raft request PRCs coming from other nodes of the cluster. This interface is
/// implemented as an `actix::Handler`, so a future will be returned which will resolve with the
/// appropriate response type.
///
/// Typically your application's networking layer will decode these message types and simply pass
/// them over to this handler, await the response, and then send the response back over the wire
/// to the caller. However, this is entirely application specific, so at the end of the day, all
/// one needs to do is send the message to this actor, await the response, and then handle the
/// response as needed by your application.
///
/// #### client request messages
/// These are messages coming from your application's clients. This interface is implemented as an
/// `actix::Handler`, so a future will be returned which will resolve with the appropriate
/// response type. Only data mutating messages should ever need to go through Raft. The contents
/// of these messages are entirely specific to your application.
///
/// #### outbound raft request
/// These are messages originating from the Raft actor which are destined for some peer node of
/// the Raft cluster. When the Raft actor is instantiated, an `actix::Recipient` must be supplied
/// which is expected to handle the networking layer logic of actually sending the message to the
/// target peer.
///
/// The networking layer is application specific, so no constraints are put in place in terms of
/// how your application's nodes are to communicate with each other. The only thing that is
/// required is that the message be sent and the response be delivered back.
///
/// Per the Raft spec, message delivery failure from a leader to a follower is to be retried
/// indefinitely, so that is how this actor is implemented.
///
/// #### storage
/// This interface is still in the works. Hopefully something like:
/// `actix::Adder<T> where T: actix::Handler<StorageMsg0> + actix::Handler<StorageMsg1> ...`.
///
/// TODO: finish this interface up.
pub struct Raft {
    /// This node's ID.
    id: NodeId,
    /// All currently known members of the Raft cluster.
    members: Vec<NodeId>,
    /// The index of the highest log entry known to be committed.
    ///
    /// Is initialized to 0, and increases monotonically.
    commit_index: u64,
    /// The index of the highest log entry which has been applied to the state machine.
    ///
    /// Is initialized to 0, increases monotonically following the `commit_index`.
    last_applied: u64,
    /// The current state of this Raft node.

    /// Raft cluster, usuall via your application's networking layer. This handler guarantees that
    /// the appropriate Raft response message type will be returned in response according to the
    /// Raft spec.
    ///
    /// ### errors
    /// It is rare that an error will be returned from this handler. The most typical error
    /// conditions are related to storage failures. In the case of a storage failure however,
    /// this actor will typically shut down, so this interface may end up not having an error
    /// case.
